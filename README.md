# Code-In-Place-Project
My Final Project for Code in Place!
"THE VAULT" is a terminal style puzzle game where players have to guess the password by deciphering secret codes to unlock the vault.
There are 4 levels.
Each level gives a coded password using different ciphers (like Caesar, Binary, Hex, etc.).
Players have 3 tries per level 
If they fail, they will be given an option to get a hint.
When all levels are cleared, a spooky surprise from a corrupted AI awaits the player!!!
